🤝 Hello there, I am Vaisakh!

🎯 I love to dig into customer problems and solve them with modern technology. I architect scalable and simple products that matter. To create this, I build wonderful teams and cultures around them to innovate and excel.

💡 Currently I am part of the team building the next-in-class connected car platform. I play leadership roles in product engineering. Key areas I am responsible for are Cyber Security, Software Over the Air Update, Data Analytics, Digital Twin and Transformation to Agile.

🚀 Last 15 years, I have been part of different teams building world-class products. I have worked in many domains throughout my career at Tata Motors, Mahindra & ZF WABCO. My domain expertise is in connected vehicles, data Science, vehicle dynamics & project management.

🏆 I created patents in the areas of connected vehicles, data science & cyber security. I published a couple of international technical papers in the area of data science. My team won the prestigious CTO’s Innovation Award at WABCO in 2018.

🧬 I enjoy discussing technology and hearing new perspectives. Reach out to me if you like to talk about emerging technologies, ACES in automotive, or anything data, and of course startups.

⚽️ It is rare to play football nowadays, but I love it.
